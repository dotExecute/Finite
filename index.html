            <h3>Why I Built This</h3>
            <div class = "story-text">
                <p>In October 2023, I found myself in the ICU with kidney failure 
                and my heart functioning at only 40% capacity. What followed were 
                months of dialysis, struggling to breathe, and watching my body 
                weight drop from 87kg to 63kg.</p>
                
                <p>During those long hours in hospital beds and dialysis chairs, 
                I had plenty of time to think about mortality. Not in an abstract 
                way, but in the very real sense of "this could be it."</p>

                <p>This app exists to remind me (and maybe you) that our time here is 
                <b><em>finite</em></b>. Not to scare or depress, but to inspire (hopefully).
                To live fully in each day we're given. To stop putting off what matters. 
                To remember that every breath is borrowed time.</p>
